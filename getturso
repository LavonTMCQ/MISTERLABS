Short answer

  - Turso (LibSQL) has a free tier suitable for this use case.
  - Yes, I prepared the agents to use a shared LibSQL/Turso database when you set two env vars in cloud: MEMORY_DATABASE_URL
  and MEMORY_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN.
  - If you prefer not to use Turso, free options include Neon or Supabase with pgvector (we can switch to @mastra/pg vector
  store).

  How to set up Turso (LibSQL) quickly on macOS

  - Install CLI:
    brew install turso
  - Login:
    turso auth login
  - Create DB:
    turso db create mister-memory
  - Get URL:
    turso db show mister-memory
    Copy the libsql:// URL shown.
  - Create auth token:
    turso db tokens create mister-memory
    Copy the token.
  - Set in your cloud environment (Mastra Cloud):
      - MEMORY_DATABASE_URL = [your libsql:// URL]
      - MEMORY_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN = [your token]
  - Deploy (agents are already wired):
      - Mister and Price Agent will now share this LibSQL/Turso DB for:
          - Conversation history (lastMessages)
          - Working Memory (Markdown profile outside context window)
          - Semantic Recall (RAG; embeddings + vector search)

  Is Turso free?

  - Yes, Turso has a free tier that’s fine for prototyping and small production tests. It’s generous enough to start and you
  can upgrade later. You’ll get a libsql:// URL and token via the CLI as shown.

  What if I don’t want to use Turso?

  - Free alternatives:
      - Neon (Postgres) + pgvector (free tier available).
      - Supabase (Postgres) + pgvector (free tier available).
  - If you choose pgvector, I can swap the vector backend to @mastra/pg and set the embedder accordingly. Your current code is
  already structured to make that switch easy.

  What I’ve already wired in the code

  - Mister and Price Agent are set to:
      - Use MEMORY_DATABASE_URL/MEMORY_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN in cloud (shared DB for both).
      - Fall back to local file: DBs during development.
      - If no vector backend is available in production, semantic recall disables itself automatically to avoid errors;
  Working Memory and conversation history still work.

  Defaults we use

  - Working Memory: enabled with a clean Markdown template for each agent (stays out of the token window).
  - Conversation history: lastMessages = 5 (good for smaller models).
  - Semantic recall: topK = 3, messageRange = 3 (concise context retrieval).
  - Timeframe phrase mapping: “today/week/month” → '24h'/'7d'/'30d'.
  - Stable filtering: On by default in top lists; includes DJED, iUSD, USDM, RSERG, etc.

  Next step

  - If you want Turso, run the CLI steps above and set the two env vars in your cloud. Ping me when that’s done and I’ll
  verify memory creation/usage in the traces and ensure semantic recall is running. If you prefer Neon/Supabase (pgvector),
  say the word and I’ll convert the vector backend to @mastra/pg.

  okay last question, if he is using the workinng emory in the cloud does that ean everything is already set up?

> Short answer: almost. Two things must be true for “working memory in the cloud” to be truly set up and persistent:

  - A real database for memory
      - You must set a persistent LibSQL/Turso URL in cloud:
          - MEMORY_DATABASE_URL
          - MEMORY_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN (if using Turso)
      - Without these, the agents fall back to file: paths which are ephemeral in cloud, so working memory won’t persist
  across restarts.
      - You do not need the Postgres token DB for memory; keep tokens in Postgres and memory in LibSQL/Turso.
  - Calls must pass memory resource + thread
      - The Playground handles thread/resource automatically.
      - Your Discord bot now sends:
          - memory.resource = discord-<userId>
          - memory.thread = channel-<channelId>
      - That means working memory fields will persist per user/channel, provided the DB above is set.

  Semantic recall (RAG) note

  - We turned on semantic recall only when a vector store is available:
      - If MEMORY_DATABASE_URL is set in cloud, semantic recall is on (vector+embedder).
      - If not, semantic recall is disabled automatically to avoid errors. Working memory and conversation history still work.

  How to finalize

  - In your cloud env, set:
      - MEMORY_DATABASE_URL = libsql://… (Turso LibSQL URL)
      - MEMORY_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN = … (if required)
  - That’s it. Mister and Price Agent already share this DB and will persist working memory + conversation history across
  sessions. Semantic recall will activate automatically.

  Verification

  - Try in cloud: tell Mister “My quote currency is USD” then ask later “What’s my quote currency?” If memory persists between
  runs, it’s working.
  - You can also check traces to see working memory updates and recalled context.
